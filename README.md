## [+] Description
A software project focused on securely hashing and storing passwords involves applying cryptographic hash functions to transform plain-text passwords into scrambled, unintelligible sequences of characters. This hashing process is designed to be one-way, meaning that the original password cannot be recovered from the hashed value. When a user creates an account and sets a password, instead of storing the password itself, the system passes the password through a hashing algorithm such as bcrypt
